    My python project involves developing a fitness regimen after having covid.   There are distinct different challenges (involving more patience and emotional support) after I recovered from covid and tried to get back to a regular exercise routine. Although I am an environmental scientist, I am also a certified group fitness instructor and I was shocked at the lack of information for people who have lingering symptoms and wanted to get back in shape.  I  wanted to use my coding project to inspire myself and others trying to get back to peak health after covid.  I chose dancing because it has the necessary emotional comnponent that is helpful from those trying to deal with decreased health and the underreported random waves of negative symptoms after covid. Dancing also has different styles with differnt bpm (beats per minute) and my code can also educate people on styles and the slower bpm they can utilize so they can safely exercise.   

I satisfied the following components:


1.  I also built a conversion tool that satifies the requirement of  calculating and displaying data based on an external factor.  I used the current date, and then displayed how many days remaining until some future date.  I used a week in the future as the end date because I wanted to use that also in the second requirement I selected a calorie counter of burnt calories.  


2. I also satisfied the requirement of creating and calling at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in the code. I determined how to calculate calories.  I then calculated the calorie count for one week. 


3.  I put in affirming exercise messages from someone who is recovering from covid to satifsy annalyzing text and determining how many words were in each sentence in a paragraph. 


4. I  satisfied the requirement of creating a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.  
I created a  dictiorary game that listed dance styles and beats per minute.  One dictinonary had slower dance styles.  The second dictionary had faster dance styles.  I then had an intersection of the dictionaries of the more intermedicate dance styes. I used the three intermediate dance styles in a game.


5. I  created  a computer generated computer game to entertain players with the this intersection of dance styles (intermediate dance styles).  I asked the user to chose from these three dance styles.  The computer (the instructor) also chose a style.  The player (dancer) gets to choose if the random pick is selected as the same dance stye. This program satsfied the second requirement of implementing a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions.


6.  I also built a conversion tool that satifies the sixth requirement.  It converts the user input of one type (kg) to another type (lbs) and displays it.  I used tkinter to generate the user's conversion form.


Correct use of Git/Github and commits:  I followed the correct steps in the project guidelines to create and name the github repository that would reflect a distinct repository.  I then used the proper guidelines to initilize the project and add files using git bash and the command line.  I then far exceeded the minimum number of commits needed to pass.    



Requriements not used:
Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data. The value of at least one object must be used somewhere in your code


Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file



Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application

Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format
Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app




Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
