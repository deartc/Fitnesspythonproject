My python project involves developing a fitness regimen.  
I got covid during the last year and I have lingering health issues that I think is an underreported issue. As a certified group fitness I think people who have the lingering health problems can be addressed with education, diet, and proper exercise and wanted to use my coding project to inspire myself and others trying to get back to peak health after covid.  
I created a  dictiorary game that listed dance styles and beats per minute.  One dictinonary had slower dance styles.  The second dictionary had faster dance styles.  I then had an intersection of the dictionaries of the more intermedicate dance styes. I then satisfied the requirement of creating a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
I then created  a computer generated computer game to entertain players with the this intersection of dance styles (intermediate dance styles).   I asked the user to chose from these three dance styles.  The computer (the instructor) also chose a style.  The player (dancer) gets to choose if the random pick is selected as the same dance stye. This program satsfied the second requirement of implementing a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions.

I also built a conversion tool that satifies the third requirement.  It converts the user input of one type (kg) to another type (lbs) and displays it.  I used tkinter to generate the user's conversion form.

I also satisfied the fourth requirement of creating and calling at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in the code. I determined how to calculate calories.  I then calculated the calorie count for one week.  I also determined if the calorie count will result in a possible weight loss or weight gain.

Requiements not used yet:



Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data. The value of at least one object must be used somewhere in your code


Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file



Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application

Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format
Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app


Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)
Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data



Correct use of Git/Github and commits:  I followed the correct steps in the project guidelines to create and name the github repository that would reflect a distinct repository.  I then used the proper guidelines to initilize the project and add files using git bash and the command line.  I then far exceeded the minimum number of commits needed to pass.
